Further improvement needed to nor depend on cs50 library

and to improve binary search with pointers


Selection Sort

    Pseudo code

    for i = 1 to n - 1
        min = i
        for j = i + 1 to n
            if array[j] < array[min]
                min = j
        if min != i
            swap array[min] and array[i]

Insertion Sort

    Pseudo code

    for i = 1 to n - 1
        element = array[i]
        j = i
        while(j > 0 and array[j - i] > element)
            array[j] = array[j - 1]
            j = j - 1
        array[j] = element
